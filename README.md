# Maven-Bookshelf-Challenge
Use Goodreads data to build a summer reading list tailored to anyone's unique tastes.
Business Case: With an overwhelming number of book options available, readers often struggle to choose what to read next—especially for summer when reading time is precious. This project aims to simplify that decision-making process by turning Goodreads data into an intuitive tool that helps users create a personalized summer reading list based on their preferences.

Approach: Using Goodreads data (1M+ reviews from 13K+ books), I built an interactive Power BI report that acts as a dynamic recommendation engine. The dataset includes two key tables:

Works Table: Book metadata—author, title, genres, publication year, page count, average rating, etc.
Reviews Table: User-generated English reviews with spoiler flags and vote counts.
Key features of the tool:

A text filter for genres to define user interests

Dependent slicers for author, title, and rating to narrow the book list

Clickable tiles that surface comprehensive book details including summary, page count, publication year, and similar books

Drill through functionality to view full reviews and helpfulness votes—enabling deeper insight before finalizing a choice

Key Insights & Impact:

Made it easy for users to discover books aligned with their genre, author, and rating preferences
Enhanced decision-making with review data, spoilers flagging, and popularity metrics
Helped transform a static dataset into an engaging, user-friendly tool supporting more confident and curated reading decisions
